=head1 NAME

usw - use utf8; use strict; use warnings; in one line.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use usw; # is just 8 bytes pragma instead of below:
 use utf8;
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 binmode \*STDOUT, ':encoding(UTF-8)';
 binmode \*STDERR, ':encoding(UTF-8)';
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

usw is a shortcut pragma mostly for one-liners.

May be useful for those who write the above code every single time

=head2 HOW TO USE

  use usw;

It is a kind of pragmas but doesn't spent
L<%^H|https://metacpan.org/pod/perlpragma#Key-naming>
because overusing it is nonsense.

C<use usw;> should be just the very shortcut at beginning of your codes

Therefore, if you want to set C<no>, you should do it the same way as before.

 no strict;
 no warnings;
 no utf8;

These still work as expected everywhere.

And writing like this doesn't work

 no usw;
